## SecretSwap: Anon Edition

Private swaps for Secret Network! Uses private entropy pool for differential privacy when reporting pools sizes.

- Swap amounts are private in the range of +-1% of the real amounts.
- Swap recipient is private.
- Higer fees, higher returns for LPs.
- Price discovery in the range of +-1% of the real price.

TODOs:

- Provide & Withdraw
- Figure out LP tokens (NFTs for privacy or SNIP20s for simplicity?)
